# Hotel Booking Cancellations, A Growing Problem…

To overcome the problems caused by booking cancellations, hotels implement rigid cancellation policies, inventory management, and overbooking strategies, which can also have a negative influence on revenue and reputation.

Once the reservation has been canceled, there is almost nothing to be done and it creates discomfort for many Hotels and Hotel Technology companies. **Therefore, predicting reservations which might get canceled and preventing these cancellations will create a surplus revenue for both Hotels and Hotel Technology companies.**

Luckily, by using Machine learning with Python, we can predict the guests who are likely to cancel the reservation and this could help produce better **forecasts** and **reduce uncertainty** in business decisions. Our goal is to automate the process of predicting booking cancellation using customer’s booking data and by building classification model.
